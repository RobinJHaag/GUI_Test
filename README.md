# GUI_Test
Testing CustomTkinter with plots.
This is a private training project for me to get familiar with the customtikinter library. 
The goal is to create a GUI that can display data in different Plots. 
The GUI should be clean and easy to use.
This Project is not meant to be something new or groundbreaking.
It's goal is for me to further my knowledge for my Bachelors Degree.
